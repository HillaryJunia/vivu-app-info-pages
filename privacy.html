        <p>If you are located outside [Your Backend Server Country/Region] and choose to provide information to us, please note that we transfer the data, including Personal Data, to [Your Backend Server Country/Region] and process it there.</p>
        <p>Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by your submission of such information represents your agreement to that transfer.</p>
        <p>The Vivu Development Team will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy and no transfer of your Personal Data will take place to an organization or a country unless there are adequate controls in place including the security of your data and other personal information.</p>

        <h2>4. Disclosure of Data</h2>
        <h3>Legal Requirements</h3>
        <p>The Vivu Development Team may disclose your Personal Data in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to:</p>
        <ul>

        <h2>5. Security of Data</h2>
        <p>The security of your data is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Data (e.g., using Spring Boot Security for our backend API), we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

        <h2>6. Service Providers</h2>
        <p>We may employ third-party companies and individuals to facilitate our Service ("Service Providers"), to provide the Service on our behalf, to perform Service-related services or to assist us in analyzing how our Service is used. These third parties have access to your Personal Data only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.</p>

        <h2>7. Links to Other Sites</h2>
        <p>Our Service may contain links to other sites that are not operated by us. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that third party's site.

We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies or practices of any third-party sites or services.</p>
